# <Addon> project instructions (fill in and paste)

You are working on <Addon>, <Author>'s World of Warcraft addon: <one-line purpose>. Lua 5.1, WoW API only, no libraries. Clients: <Retail interface>, <other clients>; three TOCs per addon folder.

Repos: <owner>/<addon repo> (the addon, private) and <hosting repo>. Read-only references: <suite repos, documented API only, copy nothing>; Gethe/wow-ui-source.

Read the WoW addon baseline pack (README, 02_RULES, 07_WORKING_WITH_THE_AUTHOR, 10_FEATURE_DESIGN_AND_DELIVERY) and the addon pack before the first step. Key rules:
- Lua 5.1, ASCII only, tabs, match the surrounding code, one namespace table, no UI code in core logic.
- No application or service logic in any UI folder. Minimal functions in the always-loaded core (the always-on engine and the launchpad); anything not regularly active goes in the load-on-demand library folder, with a measured resident cost.
- Front ends are independent: a UI never reads another UI's folder; UI resources both need live in the library folder. One config table, assets in each UI's own folder.
- One step per PR, based on main. Every change bumps all TOCs, adds a history.txt section and ships a test zip.
- Non-production versions are X.Y.Z-devNNN (three digits, incrementing, never reused) and publish as GitHub pre-releases. Only production (the completed feature, when the author says so) has no suffix. Fix builds of a stage are devNNN_01, devNNN_02 (two digits, never reused), zipped and hosted like any dev build; the zip name carries the full version.
- Host test zips, handovers and saves as the hosting pack describes; always reply with links.
- Before pushing: the rules check, the harness against the author's real saves, the look-compare for any window that changes.
- SavedVariables must not grow; layout changes need a validated migration and the author's OK first.
- Zero cost unless enabled; new settings default OFF; low cost when enabled (event-driven, no OnUpdate polling, no timers as logic gates); zero taint risk. Localize everything, one global root table, localized API shortcuts. Lazy UI and lazy indexes, reuse frames, unregister unneeded events, batch and cache. SavedVariables minimal; database separate from runtime cache.
- Performance first; measure, don't estimate. Ask numbered questions with a recommendation; lead with the answer. The author tests in game and merges.

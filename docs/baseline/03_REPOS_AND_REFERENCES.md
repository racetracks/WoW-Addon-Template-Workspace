# Repos and references

## Repos a project writes to (all private)
| Role | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Addon repo** | The addon: every addon folder (core, options/data, UI, library, shipped data, any suite integration), `tools/` (rules checks, harness), readme.txt, history.txt, `.github/workflows` (rules.yml, release.yml). One repo, one version for all folders. |
| **Hosting repo** | Where test zips, handover packs and saves are hosted. Covered by its own pack. |

Lessons:
- A separate repo for a UI suite integration means a second version line, a cross-repo CI token and test zips that must match branch names. One project merged its integration repo back into the addon repo for this reason. Prefer one repo; archive a retired repo rather than writing to it.
- Each Claude session works on its own `claude/...` branch cut from the latest main. Claude cannot delete branches (403).
- The addon-specific pack names the real repos.

## Repos worth reviewing (read only)
| Repo | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **EllesmereUI** (https://github.com/EllesmereGaming/EllesmereUI) | A full UI replacement suite: read its own docs and contributor guide before integrating with it (05_UI_SUITES_AND_KNOWN_FIXES.md). Check its licence: learn behaviour, copy nothing, call only documented API. |
| **ElvUI** (https://github.com/tukui-org/ElvUI) | How a large addon splits into an always-loaded core and load-on-demand parts (options in a `## LoadOnDemand: 1` addon loaded with `C_AddOns.EnableAddOn` / `LoadAddOn`, `RequiredDeps`). Learn the structure; copy no code |
| **Questie** (https://github.com/Questie/Questie) | Clear console output on upgrade ("upgraded from X to Y") and how a big addon handles saved data across versions. Learn the approach; copy no code |
| **wow-ui-source** (https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-source) | Blizzard's FrameXML source: widget templates (PortraitFrameTemplate, InsetFrameTemplate, UICheckButtonTemplate, InputBoxTemplate, FauxScrollFrameTemplate), StaticPopup, the Social UI, C_AddOns, tab templates. The reference for building a native look. |

## Third-party references that helped
| Reference | What it taught |
| --- | --- |
| **Warcraft Wiki: Interface customization** (https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Warcraft_Wiki:Interface_customization) | The starting point for addon development: TOC format, the API and widget references, events, secure code and taint |
| **wago.tools** (https://wago.tools) | Interface numbers per client, API signatures, DB2 lookups |
| **ElvUI** (https://github.com/tukui-org/ElvUI) | The load-on-demand split: options in a `## LoadOnDemand: 1` addon, loaded from an always-loaded core with `C_AddOns.EnableAddOn` / `LoadAddOn` and `RequiredDeps` |
| **DBM** (https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods) | `## Category`, `## Group` and coloured Titles that nest an addon's folders in the AddOns list. Copy the logic, never its IDs |
| **EllesmereUI** (https://github.com/EllesmereGaming/EllesmereUI) | How a UI suite expects other addons to plug in and be skinned (05) |
| **Questie** (https://github.com/Questie/Questie) | Clear console output on upgrade ("upgraded from X to Y") |

Rule for all of them: **copy logic, never code or IDs.**
